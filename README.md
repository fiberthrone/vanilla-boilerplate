# vanilla-boilerplate

Yet another project boilerplate.

Inspired by `create-react-app` template, but does not include `react`.
Includes `webpack` and `babel` configuration though.

## Usage

First, install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

### Run the app in development mode

```
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

### Build the app for production

```
yarn build
```

### Run test watcher in an interactive mode

```
yarn test
```
